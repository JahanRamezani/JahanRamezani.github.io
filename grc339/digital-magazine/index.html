                    <h2>Packing Light, Hiking Far</h2>
                    <p>Every ounce in your pack matters when you're logging long miles, and learning to cut weight
                        without losing essentials is a skill worth mastering. This story dives deep into ultralight
                        strategies, covering gear swaps, layering systems, and food choices that maximize efficiency.
                        We'll highlight real-world examples of what veteran thru-hikers carry and what they leave
                        behind. By the end, you'll be ready to rethink your loadout and see how far you can go with
                        less.</p>

                    <h2>Into the Wild</h2>
                    <p>High above the tree line, alpine environments offer stark beauty and delicate ecosystems. These
                        landscapes are some of the most rewarding but also the most vulnerable places to hike. We'll
                        explore how to tread lightly while enjoying wildflowers, wildlife, and windswept ridges. With
                        the right knowledge and respect, your alpine journeys can inspire awe without leaving a mark
                        behind.</p>

                    <h2>The Long Way Home</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes the best adventures come from taking the trail less traveled, even when it means a
                        longer, harder journey. This story follows a 10-day trek across rugged backcountry, sharing
                        challenges, triumphs, and lessons learned along the way. From unexpected storms to moments of
                        quiet reflection, the experience reshaped what “home” really means. It's a reminder that hiking
                        isn't always about the destination — it's about how the journey changes you.</p>

                    <h2>Water, Fire, Shelter</h2>
                    <p>Survival in the wilderness comes down to three core essentials, and mastering them can mean the
                        difference between comfort and hardship. We'll break down practical ways to secure clean water,
                        build or manage fire responsibly, and construct shelter that protects against the elements. This
                        isn't about extreme survival shows — it's about real skills every hiker and backpacker can use.
                        With these tools in your back pocket, you'll feel more confident wherever the trail leads.</p>

                    <h2>Footsteps Through History</h2>
                    <p>Many of today's most beloved hiking trails trace paths carved by those who came long before us.
                        From Indigenous trade routes to pioneer crossings, these trails hold stories etched into the
                        land. We'll explore hikes that connect past and present, showing how landscapes have shaped
                        culture and community. Walking them offers more than exercise — it offers a journey through time
                        itself.</p>
