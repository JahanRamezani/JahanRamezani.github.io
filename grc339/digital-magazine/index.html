                    <h2>The Long Way Home</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes the best adventures come from taking the trail less traveled, even when it means a
                        longer, harder journey. This story follows a 10-day trek across rugged backcountry, sharing
                        challenges, triumphs, and lessons learned along the way. From unexpected storms to moments of
                        quiet reflection, the experience reshaped what “home” really means. It's a reminder that hiking
                        isn't always about the destination — it's about how the journey changes you.</p>

                    <h2>Water, Fire, Shelter</h2>
                    <p>Survival in the wilderness comes down to three core essentials, and mastering them can mean the
                        difference between comfort and hardship. We'll break down practical ways to secure clean water,
                        build or manage fire responsibly, and construct shelter that protects against the elements. This
                        isn't about extreme survival shows — it's about real skills every hiker and backpacker can use.
                        With these tools in your back pocket, you'll feel more confident wherever the trail leads.</p>

                    <h2>Footsteps Through History</h2>
                    <p>Many of today's most beloved hiking trails trace paths carved by those who came long before us.
                        From Indigenous trade routes to pioneer crossings, these trails hold stories etched into the
                        land. We'll explore hikes that connect past and present, showing how landscapes have shaped
                        culture and community. Walking them offers more than exercise — it offers a journey through time
                        itself.</p>
