            <div class="description-header">
            <p>It all began under the sun-drenched skies of a small village in the hills of Tuscany, where David and Alexander, born into a family whose roots run as deep as the ancient olive trees that lined their home, learned the sacred art of Italian cooking.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The smells of simmering sauces, the sound of pasta being hand-rolled, and the time-honored techniques passed down through generations became more than just their heritage—they became their very essence.</p>

            <p>As children, they spent endless hours in their nonna's kitchen, watching in awe as she transformed humble ingredients into divine meals that seemed to touch the soul. David, with his meticulous nature and unwavering pursuit of perfection, learned the intricate dance of flavors. Alexander, with a wild heart and an innate sense for bold creativity, embraced the art of combining tradition with innovation. Together, they formed a bond stronger than steel, and in that bond, they found their calling.</p>

            <p>Years later, after countless kitchens, travels, and inspirations, they set foot in a new city—one that was ready to embrace the fiery soul of Italy, yet still searching for the heart of its flavor. And so, Bistro Codifica was born, a place where the traditional meets the contemporary, where every dish tells a story, and where every bite resonates with the deep, rich history of Italy itself.</p>

            <p>Here, in the heart of our restaurant, we believe in the power of simplicity. Fresh, locally sourced ingredients, painstakingly selected for their quality and authenticity, are the building blocks of our culinary philosophy. With every meal we serve, we honor our ancestors. With every plate, we weave the history of Italy into the present, ensuring that the past never fades into oblivion.</p>

            <p>This is not just a restaurant. It is a love letter to Italy. It is the echo of our nonna's laugh, the warmth of the Tuscan sun, and the passion of two brothers who chose to share the most powerful gift of all—food. And through our food, we invite you to join us on this journey, to taste what we have tasted, and to experience what we have lived.</p>
